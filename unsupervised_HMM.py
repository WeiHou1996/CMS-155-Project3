def unsupervised_HMM(X, n_states, N_iters, seed=None):
    '''
    Helper function to train an unsupervised HMM. The function determines the
    number of unique observations in the given data, initializes
    the transition and observation matrices, creates the HMM, and then runs
    the training function for unsupervised learing.
    Arguments:
        X:          A dataset consisting of input sequences in the form
                    of lists of variable length, consisting of integers
                    ranging from 0 to D - 1. In other words, a list of lists.
        n_states:   Number of hidden states to use in training.

        N_iters:    The number of iterations to train on.
        rng:        The random number generator for reproducible result.
                    Default to RandomState(1).
